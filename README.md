# pyServ

IRC Services in mSL for ircu based IRCds. (Mainly bircd)

Not currently in active development.

# pyServer:

Like mServer, this is a demonstration of linking to an ircu based IRCd via P10 protocol.

However, there is a bot to manipulate raw commands due to the difference between mIRC and Python.
